<h3 class='subheading'>Overview</h3>
<p>
We are muslim professional software engineers who are open-source enthusiasts. We focus on developing the software to estabilish the standards, especially for small to mid-sized projects. 
</p>
<!--<h3 class='subheading'>The Message</h3>
<p>
By the grace of Allah (may He be Glorified), we are muslims who try to pass the message of Islam across to the people who are either scared of Islam, because of media or any other reason, and show them that the Islam is the only way to save yourself from eternal punishment.
</p>
<p>
<a href='https://muflihun.com/4/163' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Islam was the religion of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammad</a> and all other prophets who came in-between (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon all of them). The message kept changing by the passage of time, because of evil people and devil. Everytime, there was a need of a Prophet, Allah sent them to the people, some followed them, others rejected them. The last and the final Prophet, Prophet Muhammad (may Allah's peace and blessings be upon him), came about 1400 years ago who was given last and the final Message, The Noble Qur'an (also written as Koran, Quran). Whoever read it with sincerity to search the Truth, Allah guided him to the truth and whoever read it to reject it, Allah turned his heart away from the Truth. Because Qur'an is the last Revelation from Our Lord, Allah (may He be Glorified) <a href='https://muflihun.com/15/9' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>promised us that He will Protect it</a> and His Promise is TRUE. Millions of muslims, around the world memorize Qur'an in the original text and <a href='https://muflihun.com/2/23-24' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>an open challenge of the Qur'an still stands.</a> 
 </p>
 <p>
Our message to you is to <a href='https://muflihun.com' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>read the Qur'an</a> with sincerity. It will free you from the shakles of this world and give you whole new prespective of life and show you the real reason of your creation.
</p>
<p>
We end our message with a warning to those who turn away, now that you have heard about Islam, the proof has been estabilished and you will not have any excuse when you will be standing before Your Lord, unanswerable. You MUST accept Islam NOW, otherwise, if you die in the state of disbelieve, we warn you of <a href='https://muflihun.com/17/97' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>the severe punishment</a> from <a href='https://muflihun.com/19/41-45#45' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>the Most Merciful</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you accept Islam by submitting your will to the commands of Your Lord, receive glad-tidings of being as pure (from sins) as you were when you were born. You start from scratch and most of all, Your Lord will be Pleased with you and <a href='https://muflihun.com/18/107-108' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>He will cause you to enter His Paradise.</a>
